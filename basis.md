Let 𝐵={𝒘⃑⃑⃑ 1,𝒘⃑⃑⃑ 2,⋯,𝒘⃑⃑⃑ 𝑘} be a set of vectors in a [[vector space]] 𝒲. The set 𝐵 is a basis for 𝒲 if 𝐵 is a spanning set for 𝒲 with the fewest number of elements in a spanning set for 𝒲. 

A basis is a minimal [[span]]ning set.

If a set of vectors [[span]] a [[vector space]] and are [[linearly independent]], then those vectors form a basis for that space.

The columns of every [[invertible]] matrix n by n matrix give a basis for $R^n$.

In a matrix with [[linearly dependent]] columns, the pivot columns of A form the [[basis]] for the [[Column space]] of A.
