#algorithms 

set of algorithms for finding a solution set given
- a pool of possible choices
- a set comprising successive choices

The algorithms following these general steps
1. Select next item to add via a criterion which determines the best choice at the time, ignoring past and future choices/options.
2. Check if the new set is feasible.
3. Check if the new set constitutes a full solution.
