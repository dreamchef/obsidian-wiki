Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product is 0.

Two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ are orthogonal if every vector in $V$ is ortohgonal to every vector in $W$.

Orthgonality is an individual property of matrices.

If matrix $A$ is orthogonal ($U U^T = I$), then it's tranpose is its inverse ($A^T = A^{-1}$).
