(of a [[sequence]] $(a_n)$), for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $A \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $m,n \geq N$ it follows that $|a_n - a_m| < \epsilon$.

Note that every [[converge]]nt [[sequence]] is a Cauchy sequence, is [[bounded]], and can be represented in [[rational number]]s for the purpose of computation.
