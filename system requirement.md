activities a new system must perform or support and the constrints that the new system must meet

**Functional requirements** are activities the system must perform (user's perspective).

**Nonfunctional requirements** are system characteristics other than those activities, or how well system performs the requirements (developer's view). They are usually in terms of
- usabilit - user intererface, online help, docs,
- reliability - dependability,
- performance - operation characteristics related to measures of workload (i.e. throughput, response time), and
- security - how will access be controlled? how will data be protected during storage and transmission?

Additional requirements may include
- Design constraints
- Implementation (required languages, tools, docs)
- Interface: interactions among system
- Physical: characteristics of hardware, operating conditions
- Supportability: how a system is installed, configured, maintained

System requirements are recorded in 
- [[use case]]s (use case diagram),
- software reqs specification (SRS) - set of docs that describes features and behavior of system, and
- [[user story]]
