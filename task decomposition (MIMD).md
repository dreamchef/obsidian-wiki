graph representation of a parallel computing task containing one start node and one end node, in which edge edge is a subtask.

The associated **sequential time** is the sum of all edge weights,  **speedup** is $\frac{\text{Sequential Time}}{\text{Parallel Time}}$, and the **span** is the greatest number of processors running simultaneously.

To partition (decompose), draw horizontal lines.  Each space contains the tasks one processor will do.
