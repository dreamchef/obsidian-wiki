#software-development #paradigm 

type of systems development lifecycle where on each step, the previous one is frozen

Usually the approach consists of the following discrete steps:
1. Requirements
	1. Initialization
	2. Planning
	3. Analysis
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment

## Weaknesses
- It requires accurate/detailed work breakdown structure early on.
- Scope of the project is locked down and stays the same throughout.
- Changes to scope will always extend project timeline and costs.
- Once requirements are defined, customers are not engaged during design and construction.
- Customers don't enjoy tangible benefit for a while.
