# Waterfall approach
on each step, the previous one is frozen

## Steps
1. Requirements
	1. Initialization
	2. Planning
	3. Analysis
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment

## Weaknesses
- Requires accurate/detailed work breakdown structure early on
- Scope of the project is locked down and stays the same throughout
- Changes to scope will always extend project timeline and costs
- Once requirements are defined, customers are not engaged during design and construction
- Customers don't enjoy tangible benefit for a while
