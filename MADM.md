#quantitative-analysis 

a method in quantative analysis for decision-making
1. ID goals and objectives
2. Decompose into attributes
3. Map each measure (raw data) onto common value scale using [[value function]]
4. Determine Total Value of first alternative by multiplying each measure's value by the global weight of its corresponding attribute.  Repeat for each alternative.
5. Perform [[sensitivity analysis]]
6. perform [[cost-benefit analysis]]

This process is performed on a designed hierarchical structure.
# Hierarchy Structure
## Prescriptive level
Weights totaling 100% are assigned to each item based on outside methods.
## Descriptive level (specific attributes)
Breakdown of each prescripted value.  Should be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely).
Do NOT include cost as an attribute.
