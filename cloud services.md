*Infrastructure-as-a-Service*:
computers, networking resources, storage

*Platform-as-a-Service*: hide infrastructure and provides a software development platform

*Software-as-a-Service*: access to software in a self-service, on-demand fashion; single app or entire suite

Cloud services are
- ubiquitous
- automated change management
- massively scalable
- on-demand provisioning
- rapid deployment
- leading edge architecture
- lower cost than private

At the same time, they require the user to surrender control and have less robust monitoring.
