#quantitative-analysis 

method of solving linear algebera problems by formulating them as a system of equations and inequalities (one for each constraint) plus an objective function

The methos assumes certainty (no random numbers), proportionality (no economies of scale), additivity and divisibility (fractional solutions are allowed).

# Decision variables
Quantitive decision that determines everything else in the problem (i.e. deciding what to build determines resources used and profit gained)
# Objective Function
Overall goal in the form of a math expression to be maximized or minimized
# Constraints
Limits given by the problem.  Includes things like amount of resources of available, as well as 'qualitative' constraints like nonnegativity.

# Solution Process
1. Identity decision variables, constraints, and objective
2. Write linear program algebraically
	1. Name decision variables
	2. Write constraints as equations/inequalities (Include nonnegativity)
	4. Write objective as 'Max/min/closest to *expression*'
3. Enter linear program into [[Excel]] and solve
4. Conduct [[sensitivity analysis]]
