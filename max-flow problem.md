#combinatorics 

*Given* in a directed network *G*,  the weight of each edge is viewed as a capacity (max flow per unit time), and *G* contains a [[source]] vertex and a [[sink]] vertex,

*find* a way to push as much flow from the source to the sink as possible.

# Solutions
- [[max-flow algorithm]]
- Find the maximum [[matching]] in a bipartite graph, and add source and sink.
