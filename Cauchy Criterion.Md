## For Sequences
A [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s [[converge]]s if and only if it is a [[Cauchy sequence]] in the real numbers.

This immediately implies that Cauchy sequences are [[bounded]].
## For Series
The series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges if and only if, given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n > m \geq N$ we have $|a_{m+1} +a_{m+2}+...a_n|$.
