A multidigraph $D$ has an eulerian closed path iff $D$ is weakly connected up to isolated vertices and for every vertex, inedgree equals outdegree.

A multidigraph $D$ has an eulerian path iff $D$ is weakly connected up to iisolated vertices and for all vertices iwith the posible exception of two, indegree equsl outdegree, and for at most two vertices indegree and outdegree differ by one.
