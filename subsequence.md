$$(a_{n_k}) = (a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, a_{n_3}, ...)$$

Order is the same and no repetitions are allowed.


Subsequences of a [[converge]]nt sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence

*Proof*: Assume $(a_n) \rightarrow a$, and let $(a_{n_k})$Â  be a subsequence.  Given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that $|a_n - a| < \epsilon$ whenever $n \geq N$.  Because $n_k \geq k$ for all $k$, the same $N$ will suffice for the subsequence; that is $|a_{n_k}| < \epsilon$ whenever $k \geq N$.
