Let $\vec{w}_1,\vec{w}_2, ..., \vec{w}_n$ be vectors in space $V$.  The set $\{\vec{w}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is [[linearly dependent]] if any one of the vectors $\vec{w}_q$ (where $1 \leq q \leq n$) can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the other $n-1$ vectors.

The set $\vec{w}_1, ... , \vec{w}_n$ is [[linearly dependent]] iff there exists scalars $c_1, ..., c_n$ such that
1. At least one $c_i$ is nonzero and
2. $c_1\vec{w}_1 + ... + c_n\vec{w}_n = \vec{0}$

If a basis has nontrivial [[nullspace]], its vectors are [[linearly dependent]]
