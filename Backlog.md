#software-development

a prioritized "stack" made up of epics and stories (subdivisions of epics)

- Top-priority items (top of the stack), are planned and sprintable because they are highly granular.  They can be actions, constraints, increments, dependencies, and desirements.
- Mid-stack items are less granular, but still somewhat refined and well-understood.  They can be desirements, opportunities, functionalities, depencies, and options.
- Bottom-stack items are general intentions, hopes and dreams.  They can be ideas or options.
