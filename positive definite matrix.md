a [[symmetric]] matrix with positive [[Eigenvalue]]s

A 2 by 2 matrix $S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	a & b \\
	c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}$ is positive definite if $a > 0$ and $ac - b^2 > 0$

If there are zeros along the main diagonal, the the difference $\geq 0$ (and the [[determinant]] is thus possibly $0$), the matrix is positive semidefinite.

Similar definitions exist for negative definite, negative semidefinite, and indefinite.
