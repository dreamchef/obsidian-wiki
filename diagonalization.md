The factorization $X^{-1}AX = \Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ has the [[Eigenvalue]]s of $A$ along its diagonal and $X$ is the [[Eigenvector]] matrix.

Note that in this case $\Lambda$ is similar to $A$.

# Diagonalizability
For matrix $A$ to be diagonalizable, the following must be true
- $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ has $n$ distinct Eigenvalues.
- $A$ has $n$ linearly independent Eigenvectors
- $X$ is [[invertible]]

# Diagonalization of Powers of $A$
$A^k = X\Lambda^kX^{-1}$
The Eigenvectors are unchanged and the Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1^k, ..., \lambda_n^k$ in the matrix $\Lambda^k$
