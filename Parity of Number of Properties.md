If there are $r$ properties, the number of objects having an even number of the properties is given by
$$e_0 + e_2 + e_4 + ... = \frac{1}{2}[s_0 + \sum_{t=0}^r (-2)^t s_t] = \frac{1}{2}[4^k + 2^k]$$

and the number of objects having an odd number of the properties is
$$e_1 + e_3 + e_5 + ... = \frac{1}{2}[s_0 - \sum_{t=0}^r (-2)^t s_t]$$.
