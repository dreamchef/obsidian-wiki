# Principles
A **user story** describes a part of the project requirements from the perspective of the target user:

"As a <*user type*>, I want to <*action*<> so that <*goal*>."

A **feature** is a service that fulfills a requirement.

The **product backlog** is prioritized list of user requirements used to choose work to be done in project. It is continuously prioritized, continuously granularized, and several high-priority items are worked on at any given time.

# Human Organization
A **sprint team** is a small group of developers, usually 5-9 people; no roles or titles

The **Scrum master** is a coach/project manager of sprint team.

The **product owner** maintains backlog list, prioritzes work, provides guidance and vision on what to build
