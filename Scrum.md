A **feature** is a service that fulfills a requirement.

The **product backlog** is prioritized list of user requirements used to choose work to be done in project. It is continuously prioritized, continuously granularized, and several high-priority items are worked on at any given time.

The **Scrum master** is a coach/project manager of sprint team.

The **product owner** maintains backlog list, prioritzes work, provides guidance and vision on what to build
