1. *combinatorics*: (given a graph G) the result of repeatedly adding edges between non-adjacent vertices whose degrees sum to at least n, until this can be no longer be done; denoted $c(G)$
2. *analysis*: (of a given set $A$) the set $A'$ that is the untion of $A$ and the set $L(A)$ of the limit points of $A$
