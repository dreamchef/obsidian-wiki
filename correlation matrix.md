Given a data set represented by matrix $X$, the product $X^TX$ is a corrrelation matrix where element (i,j) gives the correlation of the data object in column $i$ with the data object in column $j$.

In [[singular value decomposition]], matrix $U$ contains the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix.
