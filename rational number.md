$\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Q}$

# Proof of Countability
Set $A_1 = \{0\}$ and for $n \geq 2$ let $A_n = \{\pm \frac{p}{q} :$ where $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ are lowest terms with $p+q = n\}$.  Each A_n has a finite number of terms, because there are a finite number of natural numbers under $n-1$, and no overlap because each $p,q$ sum to exactly one natural number, for which $A_n$ is defined.  So consecutively listing the elements in each $A_n$ gives us a countably infinite set $\mathbb{Q}$.
