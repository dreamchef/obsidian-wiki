Let V be a vector [[vector space]] and suppose $\vec{v}_i \in V$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., k$.  The set of all linear combinations of the vectors $\vec{v}_i$ is the span of those vectors and is denoted $span(\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3,...,\vec{v}_k)$.

The span of a set of vectors is the [[range[[]] of the matrix with its columns those vectors.

Let $\vec{w}_1, \vec{w}_2, ..., \vec{w}_n$ and $\vec{v}$ be vectors in $R^m$.  Then $\vec{v}$ is in span $\{\vec{w}_1,\vec{w}_2,...\vec{w}_n\}$ iff the system $W\vec{c} = \vec{v}$ has solution where $W = [ \vec{w}_1 \ 	\vec{w}_n	\vec{w}_n]$ ([[consistent]]).
