#analysis #definition 
1. *[[sequence]]*: having a [[limit]] #todo
2. *[[infinite series]]*, $B$: the [[sequence of partial sums]] [[converge]]s to $B$

# Tests of Convergence For Series
- [[Cauchy Criterion]] for series
- [[Cauchy Condensation Test]]
- [[comparison test for series]]
- [[intergral test for convergence]]
- [[convergence of geometric series]]
- [[divergence test]]
- [[Abel's Test]]
- [[absolute convergence test]]
- [[convergence of alternating series]]
- [[convergence of geometric series]]

# Proof Using [[Limit]] Definition
Letting $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary, demonstrate a choice for $A \in \mathbb{N}$. Then show that $N$ actually works.

Assume $n \geq N$ and with N well chosen, derive the inequality $|x_n - x| < \epsilon$.
