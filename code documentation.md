#software-development #paradigm 

allows the developer and others to understand the code as quickly as possible

*Internal* documentation includes comments, and self-documenting code. *External* documentation includes the feature/design specification document, a "wiki" website, and document repository.

Self-documenting code refers to the practice of writing code with structure, naming, minimized control flow, and reduced data structure complexity that is friendly to a human reader.

Documentation should contain what code does to data, the meaning of variables, and explanations of functions, methods, and procedures.

Tools like Doxygen and Javadoc can extract documentation from code written in a special format.
