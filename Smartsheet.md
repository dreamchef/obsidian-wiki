web-based application for creating spreadsheets and other data management structures

To reference another sheet `External Sheet` from a cell (i.e. to use the other sheet as a lookup table), use `{External Sheet}`. To reference a specific cell in the other sheet, use `INDEX({External Sheet},row,col}`.

The `smartsheet` Python module allows scripts to fetch data from sheets using the API.
