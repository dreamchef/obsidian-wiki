# limit point
(of a point $x$ in set $A \in \mathbb{R})$), every $\epsilon$-[[neighborhood]] $V_\epsilon(x)$ of $x$ intersects the set $A$ at point other than $x$, such as [[interior point]] and endpoints of an interval; may also be an [[interior point]] or endpoint

The set of all limit points of a set $A$ is denoted $L(A)$.

A point $x$ is a limit point of set $A$if and only if $x = \lim a_n$ for some [[sequence]] $(a_n)$ contained in $A$ satisfying $a_n \neq x$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
